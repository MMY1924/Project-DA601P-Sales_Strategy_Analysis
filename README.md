# Sales Strategy Analysis Report

## Overview

A comprehensive data analysis project evaluating the effectiveness of three sales methodologies (Email, Call, Email+Call) for a new office stationery product line. The analysis provides actionable insights for sales strategy optimization based on 15,000 customer interactions across a 6-week campaign period.

## Dataset Description

- **Size**: 15,000 customer interactions
- **Time Period**: 6-week sales campaign
- **Geographic Coverage**: All 50 US states
- **Sales Methods**: Email, Call, Email + Call

### Data Schema

| Column              | Type    | Description                |
|---------------------|---------|----------------------------|
| `week`              | int64   | Week number (1-6)          |
| `sales_method`      | object  | Sales methodology used     |
| `customer_id`       | object  | Unique customer identifier |
| `nb_sold`           | int64   | Number of items sold       |
| `revenue`           | float64 | Revenue generated ($)      |
| `years_as_customer` | int64   | Customer tenure (years)    |
| `nb_site_visits`    | int64   | Website visits count       |
| `state`             | object  | Customer state location    |

## Key Findings

### Performance Metrics (TRMNS - Total Revenue per Minute per Sales)

| Sales Method | TRMNS  | Efficiency Ranking |
|--------------|--------|--------------------|
| Email        | 194.26 | 1st (Highest)      |
| Email + Call | 183.65 | 2nd                |
| Call         | 15.87  | 3rd (Lowest)       |

### Strategic Recommendations

1. **Geographic Optimization**: Implement territory-specific sales method allocation
2. **Resource Reallocation**: Prioritize Email+Call in high-performance regions
3. **Efficiency Focus**: Utilize Email methodology in resource-constrained territories

## Technical Implementation

### Requirements

```python
1.5 <= pandas
.0
1.20 <= numpy
.0
0.11 <= seaborn
.0
3.5 <= matplotlib
.0
5.0 <= plotly
.0
```

### Installation

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib plotly
```

### Usage

```python
# Load the notebook in Jupyter environment
jupyter notebook Study/Sales_Strategy_Analysis_ReportV1.ipynb
```

## Data Quality Procedures

1. **Missing Value Imputation**: Method-specific revenue imputation using group means
2. **Categorical Standardization**: Sales method naming convention normalization
3. **Business Logic Validation**: Customer tenure constraint enforcement (max 39 years)
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Complete record duplication verification

## Analysis Methodology

### 1. Data Validation and Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive missing data analysis and strategic imputation
- Categorical variable standardization and normalization
- Business logic constraint validation and correction

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Sales method distribution analysis and visualization
- Temporal performance trend identification
- Customer behavior comparative evaluation

### 3. Geographic Distribution Analysis
- Territory-based performance mapping and visualization
- Regional sales method preference identification
- Interactive choropleth mapping for stakeholder engagement

### 4. Advanced Performance Metrics
- TRMNS (Total Revenue per Minute per Sales) calculation
- Geographic efficiency optimization analysis
- Resource allocation recommendation development

## Business Impact

### Expected Financial Outcomes
- **Revenue Increase**: 28–35% through geographic optimization
- **Efficiency Improvement**: 22-30% TRMNS enhancement
- **Customer Engagement**: 15-25% improvement in regional targeting

### Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1–4): Geographic assessment and benchmarking
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 5–12): Gradual optimization implementation
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 13–24): Full deployment and monitoring

## Monitoring Framework

### Key Performance Indicators
- Geographic TRMNS performance by quarter
- Regional revenue growth rates
- Territory-specific customer engagement metrics
- Sales team productivity by region and methodology

### Reporting Schedule
- **Weekly**: Regional TRMNS tracking
- **Monthly**: Geographic performance reviews
- **Quarterly**: Strategic optimization assessments
